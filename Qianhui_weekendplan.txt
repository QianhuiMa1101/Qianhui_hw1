My plan for the weekend:
I want to organize the photos in my phone such as deleting the duplicated photos.
I'll also transfer the photos I took in the spring break into my laptop so that I have enough memory on my phone.
Some other plan would be doing homework and quiz.
I may go to the gift shop in downtown to buy a fluffy toy and Have a nice meal with my roommates.
